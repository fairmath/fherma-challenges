# Encrypted Recommendation

In today’s online retail world, personalized recommendations are key to engaging customers and driving sales. However, creating more accurate and individualized recommendations requires access to sensitive personal user information.

In this challenge, we are continue the series of challenges intersection of machine learning and privacy-preserving inference. The task is to build a recommendation model for an online store that can **predict the top-N products** each user is most likely to purchase **without compromising user privacy**.

The objectives of this challenge are:
- Apply machine learning techniques (e.g., gradient boosting or neural network) to recommendation problems.
- Adapt models for secure inference on encrypted data.
